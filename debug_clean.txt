2025-12-29 11:06:46,097 Plan: ['What are the main definitions, taxonomies, and historical milestones of **AI agents** (including LLM-based, RL-based, and multi-agent systems), and how do they differ from traditional AI/ML systems and static tools?[1][4][7]', 'What are the dominant **architectures and design patterns** for modern AI agents (e.g., memory, planning, tool use, feedback loops, multi-agent coordination), and how do they relate to underlying learning paradigms like reinforcement learning and LLM reasoning?[1][5][6][7]', 'What are the key **application domains and business use cases** of AI agents today (enterprise automation, decision support, simulations, human–AI collaboration), and what quantifiable productivity or economic impacts have been reported?[2][3][4][7]', 'What are the main **evaluation methods, benchmarks, and performance metrics** for AI agents (single-agent and multi-agent), and what open challenges exist in reliably measuring autonomy, robustness, and real-world effectiveness?[1][5][6][7]', 'What are the critical **ethical, safety, governance, and workforce implications** of deploying AI agents at scale (e.g., supervision, alignment, privacy, fairness, human–agent teaming), and what best practices or regulatory approaches are emerging to manage these risks?[1][2][3][5][7]']
